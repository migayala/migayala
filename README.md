### 👨🏽‍💻 About me
- #️⃣ I enjoy Jave the most, but have worked with other languages
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my Bachelor's in Computer Science
- 👨🏽‍💻 Currently a Metrology Technician at Monarch Tractor!
- 🛑 Since I am currently in school, my GitHub has had limited activity because I've been focusing on my schoolwork. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out.
